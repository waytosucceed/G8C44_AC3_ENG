            <u>Personification</u>
        </span>
        <br>
        Personification is a writing technique that attributes human qualities or emotions to things, objects, or ideas that are not human. This device helps paint vivid pictures and elicits feelings from the reader.
        <br><br>

        <b>Type 1: Emotional Personification</b><br>
        Emotional Personification involves assigning human emotions to non-human entities to create a deeper emotional impact. For example, “Anxiety tapped me on the shoulder, refusing to let me forget the ticking clock,” conveys how persistent anxiety can feel like a constant presence.
        <br><br>

        <b>Type 2: Anthropomorphic Personification</b><br>
        Anthropomorphic Personification gives human-like traits and actions to animals or objects. For instance, “The old book stretched its spine, eager to share its hidden tales with the curious reader,” personifies the book as if it longs to communicate its stories.
        <br><br>

        <b>Type 3: Allegorical Personification</b><br>
        Allegorical Personification turns abstract ideas into characters that deliver moral lessons. For example, “Curiosity burst through the door, pulling the children away from their screens and into the world, teaching them that the greatest adventures often lie just outside their comfort zone,” portrays Curiosity as an inviting character that encourages exploration and discovery.
        <br><br>

        <b>Type 4: Extended Personification</b><br>
        Extended Personification develops a single object’s human qualities over a longer narrative. For example, “The moon wore a silver crown as it danced among the stars, sharing gentle light with the sleeping world below, cradling dreams in its soft glow,” illustrates how the moon is depicted with human-like elegance and nurturing qualities, emphasizing its calming presence in the night sky.
